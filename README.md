# WordPressInstall
These files are intended for use on my client servers.

They are specific to the kind of set up I use.

In short: The script installs WordPress on Linux, using NGINX, MariaDB, PHP and Certbot (for Cloudflare domains). Please read the code before using it, as you'll need to provide a API Token with Zone Access only, etc.

Use at your own risk.
